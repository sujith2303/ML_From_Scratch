**Intro_to_ML**

1) Definitions and a rough overview of series telling them what we cover and all the real time projects 
2) a little math example with simple linear regression and house price prediction example
3) learning rate and gradient descent   
4) maths realted to gradient descent
5) Activation meaning
6) Implementation of cost function
7) Probability statictis (max likelihood estimation)
8) Show normalization with graphs example
9) normalization imp of normalization    
10) multiple linear regression and their associated cost
11) notations like w , x etc
12) polynomial regression
13) classifying definition with example
